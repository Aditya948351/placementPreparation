# Final Roadmap: BE First Semester (Prep Till March 2026)

Here is your detailed, realistic and **action-based roadmap**â€”balancing your available hours, exams, and internship/job target for BE 1st semester. This plan uses the Droid Dev Hub playlist for Android, and phases DSA/ML smartly.

## Oct-Dec 2025: Foundation \& Steady Progress

- **Android:**
    - Complete **1 hour/day** (playlist: [Droid Dev Hub Android Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLti2cUZX-C8c25FXmBb5pvvjStboKqPYx)).
        - Focus: Kotlin basics, Android Studio setup, XML UI, Jetpack Compose foundation, simple apps.
        - By December end: Finish up to around playlist video \#70â€“90 (grasp core Android, Composables, layouts).
    - **Pause/slow during exams** (late Novâ€“early Dec).
- **DSA (C++):** Minimalâ€”just revise basics 1â€“2x/week for retention during exams.
- **ML:** Put on hold. Just brush up OpenCV basics and bookmark TensorFlow resources for January.


## Jan-Feb 2026: Deepen \& Accelerate

- **Android:**
    - **Increase to 2â€“3 hours/day** (after exams finish).
    - Complete playlist through advanced topics: project builds, architecture (MVVM), Room DB, Retrofit (REST API), Firebase, Maps, Dependency Injection.
    - Target: **Video \#180â€“200** by late Feb. Build at least **one big original app** by then (e.g., Shopping List or Recipe App variant).
- **DSA (C++):**
    - Restart daily (1â€“1.5 hr/day).
    - Work on LeetCode, GFG, focus on arrays, strings, trees, sorting/searching, DP. Set a goal: **40â€“60 solved problems by March.**
- **ML:**
    - In January, work 30â€“40 minutes/day on **OpenCV** and **TensorFlow** basics. Implement a small demo ML project if time allows (e.g., image classifier with TensorFlow, basic OpenCV app).


## March 2026: Polish, Build Portfolio \& Apply

- **Android:**
    - Finalize major app(s). Polish code, README, screenshots. **Deploy at least one app to the Play Store or open-source on GitHub.**
    - Summarize your learningâ€”write a medium article or LinkedIn post about your Android journey (shows communication skills!).
- **DSA/Interview Prep:**
    - Mock interviews (with peers, online).
    - Practice common Android and DSA interview questions.
- **ML:**
    - Just maintain; youâ€™ll return later for advanced ML if needed.
- **Apply:**
    - Resume: **Update resume and LinkedIn with all new projects, skills, and achievements.**
    - Start **applying for internships and jobs on LinkedIn, Internshala, AngelList, company portals, and through your Capgemini referral**. Target roles: Android Developer Intern, Software Engineer Intern, and related titles.
    - Begin leveraging SIH experience, research, and hackathons for application strength.


## Key Portfolio Actions

- **GitHub:** Document all big projects cleanlyâ€”readmes, instructions, screenshots.
- **LinkedIn:** Post short demos, progress updates, and connect to recruiters/peers.
- **Resume:** Highlight Android dev, DSA (C++), ML foundations, research/hacks/leadership.
- **Referrals:** Continue reaching out to alumni and teammates for possible referrals at target companies.
